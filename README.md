# vectorembeddings

This project focuses on analyzing the frequency and structure of words and tokens in a text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It explores various methods of vector representation, including One-Hot Encoding, Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Term-Term Frequency Matrices. These methods are applied to a Portuguese poem to demonstrate how vector embeddings can be used to analyze textual data.

📊 NLP Text Analysis with Vector Embeddings

✨ Features

🔢 One-Hot Encoding: Represents words as binary vectors based on their presence in the vocabulary.

📊 Bag of Words (BoW): Counts the frequency of words in a document.

📈 Term-Term Frequency Matrix: Analyzes how often terms co-occur in the same document.

📉 TF-IDF: Weighs the importance of words in a document relative to a corpus.

🗑️ Stopword Removal: Reduces noise by removing common stopwords from the text.

📦 Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
nltk
scikit-learn (for vectorization and TF-IDF)
matplotlib or seaborn (optional, for visualizations)
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

🚀 Usage

1️⃣ Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2️⃣ Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd your-repo-name

3️⃣ Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook 3_NLP_vector_embedding.ipynb

4️⃣ Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the text, generate vector embeddings, and analyze the data.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a Brazilian poem by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:

python
Copy
Edit
poema = [
    'E agora, José?', 'A festa acabou', 'a luz apagou', 'o povo sumiu', 'a noite esfriou', 
    'e agora, José?', 'e agora, você?', 'você que é sem nome', 'que zomba dos outros', 
    'você que faz versos', 'que ama, protesta?', 'e agora, José?'
]
You can replace this with your own text data by modifying the poema variable in the notebook.

📜 Code Structure

The Jupyter notebook is organized as follows:

📌 One-Hot Encoding: Demonstrates how to represent words as binary vectors.

📊 Bag of Words (BoW): Counts the frequency of words in the poem.

📈 Term-Term Frequency Matrix: Analyzes how often terms co-occur in the same document.

🗑️ Stopword Removal: Removes common stopwords to reduce noise in the analysis.

📉 TF-IDF: Weighs the importance of words in the poem using TF-IDF.

📊 Results

This project provides insights into:

✅ The most frequent words in the text.

✅ The relationships between words based on their co-occurrence.

✅ The importance of words in the text using TF-IDF.

📝 Example Outputs:

🔢 One-Hot Encoding: Binary vectors representing the presence of words in the vocabulary.

📊 Bag of Words: A matrix showing the frequency of each word in the poem.

📈 Term-Term Frequency Matrix: A matrix showing how often terms co-occur.

📉 TF-IDF: A matrix showing the weighted importance of words in the text.
